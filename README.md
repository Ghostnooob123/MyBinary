# MyBinary
Is a simple software which purpose is to convert binary code to decimal fast and easy for everyone to use.

# Example
In this process, you put a binary number (base 2) and convert it into its equivalent decimal representation (base 10).

For instance, to convert the binary number 1010 to decimal:
1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0 = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10 (decimal)
0 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 (decimal)
1 * 2^5 + 0 * 2^4 + 1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2^0
= 32 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0
= 42 (decimal)
